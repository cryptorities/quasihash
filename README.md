Quasigroup  string transformations

### One-way permitations

Almost all known and well established one-way functions and one-way permutations in modern cryptography are based on intractable problems from number
theory or closely related mathematical fields such as theory of finite fields, sphere
packing or coding theory.

In this lib is constructed a new family of one-way functions and one-way
permutations defined on a finite set Q = {0, 1, . . . , s âˆ’ 1} with s elements. The
construction is based on the theory of quasigroups, and quasigroup string transformations. This approach in opposite to other approaches, is completely based on a mathematical field not closely related to the field of
number theory. By some of their properties (such as speed of computation, security level of inversion) quasigroup one-way functions outperform all currently known one-way candidate functions.
